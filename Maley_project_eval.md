####DH Project Review Essay
#Voyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database

###Introduction
The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history. This piece is a Digital Humanities review of *[Voyages](http://www.slavevoyages.org/),* an open access website dedicated to compiling and transcribing data from the 16th-19th centuries pertinent to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Much of the data gathered by this project are maps, images, numbers, and names in an attempt to create a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages. *Voyages* uses data that has been collected and formatted into machine-readable formats from as early as the late 1960s. The idea of a multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages was conceived by *Voyages* founders David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in 1990 and a CD-ROM of the dataset was published in 1999. Due to a grant from Emory University in 2006, *Voyages* launched as an open access website, the project's current form. The review is composed of three sections inspired by Shannon Mattern's piece [Evaluating Multimodal Work, Revisited;](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-multimodal-work-revisited-by-shannon-mattern/) those sections being Concept & Content, Design & Technique, and Collaboration & Documentation. *Voyages* is a well-grounded project that serves as a powerful tool and has received contributions from many scholars, dubbing it as a major success as a DH project.

###Concept & Content
The site exhibits powerful search and filtering tools from data compiled from a multitude of scholars through 40 years of work. The concept that drives the *Voyages* project is the creation of a single multisource dataset of the trans-Atlantic slave voyages. The data that *Voyages* uses is a compilation of over 40 years of work from a [long list](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/data) of scholars. Primary lead of the project David Eltis has compiled about 35,000 individual slaving expiditions between 1514 and 1866, each of which can be found through the powerful tools the site offers. Also, from researchers to programmers, the project appropriately [cites](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/history) the main contributes and credits other scholars that have had an impact on the project.

###Design & Technique
*Voyages* presents the data in a comprehensive way, allowing the user to access the data in a manageable and organized manner. The main tool for users of the site is a powerful search engine for voyages that took place during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The site allows the user to filter their search criteria to find a specific voyage, a small group of voyages, or a large subset of the data over a variety of variables. Other tools include a [name search](http://www.slavevoyages.org/resources/names-database), an [image database](http://www.slavevoyages.org/resources/images/), and an [estimates tool](http://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates). The user is given access to more search and filter selections in these tools. The name search and image database are similar in the way that they allow the user to easily search for and filter their desired criteria. The estimates tool is a well-presented list of estimated totals regarding the voyages from the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Each of the tools are easy to use, work quickly, and comprehensive to the user. These qualities of tools provided by the site are essential when building a successful DH project. 

###Collaboration & Documentation
Proper documentation and collaboration are pertinent to successful DH projects, *Voyages* has an entire [section](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/) of the site dedicated to the history and contributions made from scholars. Eltis writes a [brief history](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/history) of the site where he includes the journey the project has endured through its creation and maintenance. The site does not explicitly say the project was built using an open source format, however, there are links for future [contribution](http://www.slavevoyages.org/accounts/login/) and [contact information](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/contacts) for the content manager. Also given both the sheer [number of contributors](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/team) and positive outcome of the project built, it is assumed that while the project was being built, appropriate communication and version control was used. Overall, signs of appropriate collaboration and documentation of the project can be found on the site, further contributing to the success of the project.

###Conclusion
Due to the completed criteria of many of the guidelines given by Mattern's piece [Evaluating Multimodal Work, Revisited,](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-multimodal-work-revisited-by-shannon-mattern/) Eltis' *Voyages* project is a successful DH project. The site contains powerful tools allowing the user to easily sift through voyage data from the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The data was compiled by many scholars and the site was built by many developers; two keys to successful DH projects. Finally, the sheer power and ease-of-use of the tools on the site really let the project standout as a successful DH project.
