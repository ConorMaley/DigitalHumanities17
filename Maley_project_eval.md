#Voyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database

###Introduction
The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history. This piece is a Digital Humanaties review of *[Voyages](http://www.slavevoyages.org/),* an open access web site dedicated to compiling and transcribing data from the 16th-19th centuries pertinent to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Much of the data gathered by this project are maps, images, numbers, and names in an attempt to create a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages. *Voyages* uses data that has been collected and formatted into machine-readable formats from as early as the late 1960s. The idea of a multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages was concevied by *Voyages* founders David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in 1990 and a CD-ROM of the dataset was published in 1999. Due to a grant from Emory University in 2006, *Voyages* launched as an open access website, the project's current form. The review is composed of three sections inspired by Shannon Mattern's piece [Evaluating Multimodal Work, Revisited;](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-multimodal-work-revisited-by-shannon-mattern/) those sections being Concept & Content, Design & Technique, and Collaboration & Documentation. *Voyages* is a well-grounded project that serves as a powerful tool and has recieved contributions from many scholars, dubbing it as a major success as a DH project.

###Concept & Content
The site exhibits powerful search and filtering tools from data compiled from a multitude of scholars through 40 years of work. The concept that drives the *Voyages* project is the creation of a single multisource dataset of the trans-Atlantic slave voyages. The data that *Voyages* uses is a compilation of over 40 years of work from a [long list](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/data) of scholars. About 35,000 individual slaving expiditions between 1514 and 1866 are found in this project. From researchers to programmers, the project appropriately [cites](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/history) the main contributers and credits other scholars that have had an impact on the project.

###Design & Technique
The site presents the data in a comprehensive way, allowing the user manageably to access the data in an organized manner. The main tool for users of the site is a powerful search engine for voyages that took place during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The site allows the user to filter their search critera to find a specific voyage, a small group of voyages, or a large subset of the data over a variety of variables. Other tools include a [name search](http://www.slavevoyages.org/resources/names-database), an [image database](http://www.slavevoyages.org/resources/images/), and an [estimates tool](http://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates). The user is given access to more search and filter selections in these tools. The name search and image database are similar in the way that they allow the user to easily search for and filter their desired criteria. The estimates tool is a well-presented list of estimated totals regarding the voyages from the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Each of the tools are easy to use, work quickly, and comprehensive to the user.
