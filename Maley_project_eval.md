#Voyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database

###Introduction
The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history. This piece is a Digital Humanaties review of *[Voyages](http://www.slavevoyages.org/),* an open access web site dedicated to compiling and transcribing data from the 16th-19th centuries pertinent to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Much of the data gathered by this project are maps, images, numbers, and names in an attempt to create a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages. *Voyages* uses data that has been collected and formatted into machine-readable formats from as early as the late 1960s. The idea of a multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages was concevied by *Voyages* founders David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in 1990 and a CD-ROM of the dataset was published in 1999. Due to a grant from Emory University in 2006, *Voyages* launched as an open access website, the project's current form. The review is composed of three sections inspired by Shannon Mattern's piece [Evaluating Multimodal Work, Revisited;](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-multimodal-work-revisited-by-shannon-mattern/) those sections being Concept & Content, Design & Technique, and Collaboration & Documentation. *Voyages* is a well-grounded project that has recieved contributions from many scholars and is  and is a major success as a DH project.
