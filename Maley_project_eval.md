#Voyages: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database

###Introduction
The trans-Atlantic slave trade was the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history. This piece is a Digital Humanaties review of *[Voyages](http://www.slavevoyages.org/),* an open access web site dedicated to compiling and transcribing data from the 16th-19th centuries pertinent to the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Much of the data gathered by this project are maps, images, numbers, and names in an attempt to create a single multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages. *Voyages* uses data that has been collected and formatted into machine-readable formats from as early as the late 1960s. The idea of a multisource dataset of trans-Atlantic slave voyages was concevied by *Voyages* founders David Eltis and Stephen Behrendt in 1990 and a CD-ROM of the dataset was published in 1999. Due to a grant from Emory University in 2006, *Voyages* launched as an open access website, the project's current form. The review is composed of three sections inspired by Shannon Mattern's piece [Evaluating Multimodal Work, Revisited;](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-multimodal-work-revisited-by-shannon-mattern/) those sections being Concept & Content, Design & Technique, and Collaboration & Documentation. *Voyages* is a well-grounded project that serves as a powerful tool and has recieved contributions from many scholars, dubbing it as a major success as a DH project.

###Concept & Content
The site exhibits powerful search and filtering tools from data compiled from a multitude of scholars through 40 years of work. The concept that drives the *Voyages* project is the creation of a single multisource dataset of the trans-Atlantic slave voyages. The data that *Voyages* uses is a compilation of over 40 years of work from a [long list](http://www.slavevoyages.org/about/data) of scholars. About 35,000 individual slaving expiditions between 1514 and 1866 are found in this project. The main tool for users of the site is a powerful search engine for voyages that took place during the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The site allows the user to filter their search critera to find a specific voyage, a small group of voyages, or a large subset of the data over a variety of variables. Other tools include a [name search](http://www.slavevoyages.org/resources/names-database), an [image database](http://www.slavevoyages.org/resources/images/), and an [estimates tool](http://www.slavevoyages.org/assessment/estimates). The user is given access to more search and filter selections in these tools. Each of the tools are easy to use, work quickly, and comprehensive to the user.
